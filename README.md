## What are Candlestick Patterns?

Candlestick patterns are a type of technical analysis that uses the
shape and position of candlesticks on a price chart to identify
potential trading opportunities.

Candlesticks are a graphical representation of price movement over a
specific period of time, typically one minute, five minutes, or one
hour.

Each candlestick consists of a body and two wicks (also known as
shadows).

-   The body of the candlestick represents the difference between the
    opening and closing prices.
-   The upper wick represents the highest price reached during the
    period.
-   The lower wick represents the lowest price reached during the
    period.

By studying the shape and position of candlesticks, traders can identify
potential trading opportunities.

## How to Use Candlestick Patterns in Quotex Trading

There are many different candlestick patterns that traders can use to
identify potential trading opportunities.

Some of the most popular candlestick patterns include:

-   Bullish engulfing pattern
-   Bearish engulfing pattern
-   Hammer pattern
-   Hanging man pattern
-   Doji pattern

Each candlestick pattern has its own unique characteristics and can be
used to identify different types of trading opportunities.

For example, a bullish engulfing pattern is a bullish reversal pattern
that occurs when a red candlestick is followed by a green candlestick
that engulfs the body of the red candlestick.

This pattern indicates that the bulls are in control and that the price
is likely to continue to rise.
